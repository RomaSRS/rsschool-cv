### My goal is to learn how to make web applications. I would also like to acquire a new profession in demand on the labor market, to meet new interesting people. I think it’s no secret that a good programmer makes - good money. This is my motivation. In recent years, I have been working as an analyst, working with databases. I always liked to analyze, try to find some solutions often in unusual situations. Diving into programming, I realize that I have to learn, learn something new every day, as technologies develop every day!
### 1. I'm learning JavaScript, HTML, markdown syntax, work with Git.  
   ### 2. Code examples:  
```
let calculator = {
    sum () {
      return this.a + this.b;
    },

    mul () {
      return this.a * this.b
    },

    read () {
      this.a = +prompt ('a?', '0');
      this.b = +prompt ('b?', '0');
    }
  };

  calculator.read();
  alert( calculator.sum() );
  alert( calculator.mul() );

```
or
```
function Calculator () {
  
    this.read = function () {
      this.a = +prompt ('a?', '0');
      this.b = +prompt ('b?', '0');
    },
  
    this.sum = function () {
      return this.a + this.b;
    },
  
    this.mul = function () {
      return this.a * this.b
    }
  };
  s
  let calculator = new Calculator();
  calculator.read();
  
  alert( "Sum = " + calculator.sum() );
  alert( "Mul = " + calculator.mul() );
```
### I have no experience in programming, only solving any tasks in teaching JS and HTML.
