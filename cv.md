### 3. Self-presentation.
My goal is to learn how to make web applications. I would also like to acquire a new profession in demand on the labor market, to meet new interesting people. I think it’s no secret that a good programmer makes - good money. This is my motivation.  
In recent years, I have been working as an analyst, working with databases. I always liked to analyze, try to find some solutions often in unusual situations.  
Diving into programming, I realize that I have to learn, learn something new every day, as technologies develop every day!  
### 4. My skills.
I'm learning JavaScript, HTML, markdown syntax, work with Git.  
### 5. Code examples:  
```
let calculator = {
    sum () {
      return this.a + this.b;
    },

    mul () {
      return this.a * this.b
    },

    read () {
      this.a = +prompt ('a?', '0');
      this.b = +prompt ('b?', '0');
    }
  };

  calculator.read();
  alert( calculator.sum() );
  alert( calculator.mul() );

```
or
```
function Calculator () {
  
    this.read = function () {
      this.a = +prompt ('a?', '0');
      this.b = +prompt ('b?', '0');
    },
  
    this.sum = function () {
      return this.a + this.b;
    },
  
    this.mul = function () {
      return this.a * this.b
    }
  };
  s
  let calculator = new Calculator();
  calculator.read();
  
  alert( "Sum = " + calculator.sum() );
  alert( "Mul = " + calculator.mul() );
```  
### 6. Experience.
I have no experience in programming, only solving any tasks in teaching JS and HTML.

### 7. Education.
I have higher education, graduated from the Belarusian National Technical University with a degree in optoelectronic and laser devices and systems. Engineer.  
I also watched online webinars and layout intensives from Skillbox.

### 8. English.

Unfortunately, I did not study English at school. I’m self-educating in this direction: Interner, various applications on the phone, watching videos on YouTube.
